Main Window is divided into three functional tabs:\n\
\n\
+ Companies tab\
\n\
+ Links tab\
\n\
+ Interactive Map tab\
\n\
At the bottom of the window is a status bar showing the current information about the working project (project name, number of companies, number of communications).\
\n\
The following functions are located in the menu bar:\
\n\
\nFile - New project - erases the existing project and creates a new one.\
\n\nFile - Open a Project - opens a window with the selection of the existing project file.\
\n\nFile - Save - saves the current working project to the project file in use.\
\n\nFile - Save As - saves the current working project as a new project file.\
\n\nEdit - Prim! - runs the Prima algorithm for an open working project, if possible.\
\n\nEdit - Analyse - runs the connectivity analysing and show the result in new window.\
\n\nChange Language - changes the language (Russian and English are available).\
\n\nHelp - Manual - launches the current manual.\
\n\nHelp - about the Program - informs about the version of the program and its developer.
tips.tools=Tabs, Tools, Tasks
tips.toolsnotes=\nThe first tab is intended for viewing, adding, editing and deleting businesses within the project. \
\nThis work is carried out by means of buttons "Add", "Edit", "Delete". \
\nYou can assign the following attributes to an enterprise:\
\n- First name\
\n- Monetary capital\
\n- Address or contact information\
\n- Year of foundation\
\n\
\nAll items are required.\
\n\n\nThe second tab is a two-level list of communications. \
\nAt the first, all companies from the project are located, on the second - links with neighboring enterprises. Within each element of the first level, the "Add" button is available to add new communication with the selected enterprise. Cells of existing links have buttons "Edit" and "Delete" for, respectively, correction of the price of communication or its removal. When you click the "Add" or "Edit" button, the selected editing / creating communication window opens. When you enter a neighbor company (in case of creation), you can see the companies available for connection in the pop-up list, which simplifies the search for the desired neighbor enterprise.\
\n\
\nThe third tab is intended for interactive viewing of the links built in the program. \
\nThe workspace is a map on which enterprises are placed in the form of circles, signed by their name, and communications in the form of direct lines connecting these circles. \
\n\nThe whole map is interactive, the company-circles can be moved on the surface with the mouse. Their position is preserved when the project is saved. \
\nAlso, the following controls are available above the main map:\
\n\nSlider "Zoom" - allows you to change the scale of the map, increasing or decreasing it. The extreme positions are 25% and 250%. \
\nThe "On / Off Prices" button allows you to display or hide communication prices directly on the map.\
\n\
\n\nWhen you click "Algo-Prim!" a new window is launched, where a new system is displayed, built using a greedy algorithm in the form of a map and a list of selected communication algorithms. \
\n\nIf desired, you can save the result as a new project file, or as a workbook in the Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. The same goes for the working project itself.
